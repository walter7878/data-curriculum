# Welcome to Proba Causal Infer dot M D :-) 

### Resources to learn Experiment Design, A/B testing, Bayes applications to Decision Science, Graphical Modelling, MCMC and probabilistic programming among other -related- topics.

---

## 1. General Intros and MOOCs

### 1.1. [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization (Stanford Uni / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models). Composed of 3 courses, Representation, Inference and Learning. Offered by Stanford University via Coursera.
### 1.2. [Introduction to Computational Statistics for Data Scientists Specialization (Databricks / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/compstats). Practical Bayesian Inference with PyMC3. A conceptual understanding of the techniques and the tools used to perform scalable Bayesian inference in practice. By Dr. Srijith Rajamohan, offered by Databricks in Coursera. Composed by 3 courses: Intro to Bayesian Statistics, Bayesian inference with MCMC and Intro to PyMC3 for Bayesian Modeling and Inference. 
### 1.3. [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data?utm_source=ocwprod-mit-opencourseware&utm_medium=affiliate_partner?utm_source=OCW&utm_medium=CHP&utm_campaign=OCW). EDX verdsion of the MIT 6.041, much more dense (see item 3.1 below)
### 1.4. [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis (UC SC / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics). Very gentle introduction to Bayesian Stats. This course introduces the Bayesian approach to statistics, starting with the concept of probability and moving to the analysis of data.
### 1.5. [Data Science in Real Life (Coursera / Johns Hopkins)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/real-life-data-science#syllabus). In some units, nice high level material on experiment design, causality, among other topics. [Course Promo in YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIYmw5wnBI).
### 1.6. [Measuting Causal Effects in the Social Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/causal-effects). 
### 1.7. [A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data (Coursera / Penn)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality). "We have all heard the phrase “correlation does not equal causation.”  What, then, does equal causation?  This course aims to answer that question and more!"
### 1.8. [Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p? (Coursera / U of London)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-statistics#syllabus). On the basic side, but ok in case you need a refresher on the fundamentals. 



## 2. Talks and Conferences, generally Youtubes 

### 2.1. [Bayesian A/B Testing - Marc Garcia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxEFAkDlkiA). PyData talk. 
### 2.2. [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Modeling with PyMC3 - Christopher Fonnesbeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-kBB2I4QlE). Talk by CF at Montreal Python. 
### 2.3. [John Salvatier: Bayesian inference with PyMC 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVbJ4jEoOfU). From PyData Seattle 2015.
### 2.4. [Nora Neumann - Usable A/B testing – A Bayesian approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqtcNZDj4A).


## 3. University Courses

### 3.1 [Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/video-lectures/). This are de MIT sessions recorded. Very good material but not designed as MOOC. For a more remote-learning approach, see item 1.3

## 4. Articles and posts

## 4.1 A/B Testing

### 4.1.1 [How Not To Run an A/B Test](https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html)
### 4.2.2 [Is your A/B testing effort just chasing statistical ghosts?](https://booking.ai/is-your-a-b-testing-effort-just-chasing-statistical-ghosts-eb85602bef7e)
### 4.3.3 [Simple Sequential A/B Testing](https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html)
### 4.4.4 [https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html). On the technical side, but a real goldmine.

## 4.2 MCMC

### 4.2.1 [Bayesian inference problem, MCMC and variational inference](https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-inference-problem-mcmc-and-variational-inference-25a8aa9bce29)
