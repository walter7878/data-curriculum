## 01 General Intros and MOOCs
1. [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization (Stanford Uni / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models). Composed of 3 courses, Representation, Inference and Learning. Offered by Stanford University via Coursera.
2. [Introduction to Computational Statistics for Data Scientists Specialization (Databricks / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/compstats). Practical Bayesian Inference with PyMC3. A conceptual understanding of the techniques and the tools used to perform scalable Bayesian inference in practice. By Dr. Srijith Rajamohan, offered by Databricks in Coursera. Composed by 3 courses: Intro to Bayesian Statistics, Bayesian inference with MCMC and Intro to PyMC3 for Bayesian Modeling and Inference. 
3. [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data?utm_source=ocwprod-mit-opencourseware&utm_medium=affiliate_partner?utm_source=OCW&utm_medium=CHP&utm_campaign=OCW). EDX verdsion of the MIT 6.041, much more dense (see item 3.1 below)
4. [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis (UC SC / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics). Very gentle introduction to Bayesian Stats. This course introduces the Bayesian approach to statistics, starting with the concept of probability and moving to the analysis of data.
5. [Data Science in Real Life (Coursera / Johns Hopkins)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/real-life-data-science#syllabus). In some units, nice high level material on experiment design, causality, among other topics. [Course Promo in YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIYmw5wnBI).
6. [Measuting Causal Effects in the Social Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/causal-effects). 
7. [A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data (Coursera / Penn)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality). "We have all heard the phrase “correlation does not equal causation.”  What, then, does equal causation?  This course aims to answer that question and more!"
8. [Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p? (Coursera / U of London)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-statistics#syllabus). On the basic side, but ok in case you need a refresher on the fundamentals. 
9. [A/B Testing by Google Online Experiment Design and Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257). This course will cover the design and analysis of A/B tests, also known as split tests, which are online experiments used to test potential improvements to a website or mobile application. Two versions of the website are shown to different users - usually the existing website and a potential change. Then, the results are analyzed to determine whether the change is an improvement worth launching.

## 02 Talks and Conferences, generally Youtubes 

1. [Bayesian A/B Testing - Marc Garcia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxEFAkDlkiA). PyData talk. 
2. [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Modeling with PyMC3 - Christopher Fonnesbeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-kBB2I4QlE). Talk by CF at Montreal Python. 
3. [John Salvatier: Bayesian inference with PyMC 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVbJ4jEoOfU). From PyData Seattle 2015.
4. [Nora Neumann - Usable A/B testing – A Bayesian approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqtcNZDj4A).


## 03 University Courses

1. [Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/video-lectures/). This are de MIT sessions recorded. Very good material but not designed as MOOC. For a more remote-learning approach, see item 1.3

## 04 Articles and posts

## 4.1 A/B Testing

1. [How Not To Run an A/B Test](https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html)
2. [Is your A/B testing effort just chasing statistical ghosts?](https://booking.ai/is-your-a-b-testing-effort-just-chasing-statistical-ghosts-eb85602bef7e)
3. [Simple Sequential A/B Testing](https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html)
4. [https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html). On the technical side, but a real goldmine.
5. [A/B Testing Explained + a Collection of A/B Testing Learning Resources](https://soshace.com/ab-testing-resources/).
6. [The Surprising Power of Online Experiments](https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments)
7. [“Controlled experiments on the web: survey and practical guide”,](https://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/controlledExperimentDMKD.pdf) a paper written by Ron Kohavi from Microsoft, is an absolute must-read, which many reviewers have found to be even better than any other written material or book on the topic: it gives an overview of the problem, covers in great detail the controlled experiments performed, a lot of mathematical data with explanations and reasons for using each, and finishes with a comprehensive analysis of the test outcomes.
8. [Bayesian inference; How we are able to chase the Posterior](https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2019/06/10/bayesian-inference-how-we-are-able-to-chase-the-posterior/) Amazing article with clear code examples. Also MCMC commented. More here: https://www.ritchievink.com/tags/bayesian/
9. [Bayesian AB testing whitepaper](https://vwo.com/downloads/VWO_SmartStats_technical_whitepaper.pdf)


## 4.2 MCMC

1. [Bayesian inference problem, MCMC and variational inference](https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-inference-problem-mcmc-and-variational-inference-25a8aa9bce29)

## 4.3 Experiment Design
