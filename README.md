# data-curriculum
Permanent work in progress. If you think there is something interesting that belongs to this list, let me know.

So far, in this repo:

* [The Data curriculum](https://github.com/walter7878/data-curriculum/blob/master/datacurri.md ). A collection of learning material. 

* WIP - Selected Libraries, Modules and Tools. A selection of things I find useful, interesting or curious. More hands-on material for somehow experienced users. 

WHG.
