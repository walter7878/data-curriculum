# data-curricula
Permanent work in progress. If you think there is something interesting that belongs to this list(s), let me know.

So far, in this repo:

* [The Data curriculum](https://github.com/walter7878/data-curriculum/blob/master/datacurri.md ). A collection of learning material. Analytics, DS, ML, etc. From medium to advanced, and mostly focused on Python, when a programming language is relevant.

* [Selected Libraries, Modules and Tools](https://github.com/walter7878/data-curriculum/blob/master/libs.md). A selection of things I find useful, interesting or curious. More hands-on material for somehow experienced users. Again, mostly Python centric.

* [Probable Cause](https://github.com/walter7878/data-curriculum/blob/master/probacausalinfer.md). Resources to learn Experiment Design, A/B testing, Bayes applications to Decision Science, Graphical Modelling, MCMC and probabilistic programming among other -related- topics.
