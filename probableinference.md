## 1. General Intros and MOOCs

### 1.1. [Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization (Stanford Uni / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models). Composed of 3 courses, Representation, Inference and Learning. Offered by Stanford University via Coursera.
### 1.2. [Introduction to Computational Statistics for Data Scientists Specialization (Databricks / Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/compstats). Practical Bayesian Inference with PyMC3. A conceptual understanding of the techniques and the tools used to perform scalable Bayesian inference in practice. By Dr. Srijith Rajamohan, offered by Databricks in Coursera. Composed by 3 courses: Intro to Bayesian Statistics, Bayesian inference with MCMC and Intro to PyMC3 for Bayesian Modeling and Inference.
