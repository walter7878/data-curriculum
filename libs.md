We currently support: Forecasting, Time series classification, Time series regression. sktime provides dedicated time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools for building, tuning, and evaluating composite models. From the Alan Turing Institute.
* [Pmdarima](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima). Pmdarima (originally pyramid-arima, for the anagram of 'py' + 'arima') is a statistical library designed to fill the void in Python's time series analysis capabilities. This includes: The equivalent of R's auto.arima functionality.
* [tslearn](https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn). A machine learning toolkit dedicated to time-series data.
* [pyts](https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts). A Python package for time series classification.
* [CESIUM](https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium). Open-Source Platform for Time Series Inference.
* [AtsPy](https://github.com/firmai/atspy). Automated Time Series Models in Python (AtsPy). Easily develop state of the art time series models to forecast univariate data series. Simply load your data and select which models you want to test. This is the largest repository of automated structural and machine learning time series models.


## Causal inference
* [DoWhy](https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy). From Microsoft. DoWhy is a Python library for causal inference that supports explicit modeling and testing of causal assumptions. DoWhy is based on a unified language for causal inference, combining causal graphical models and potential outcomes frameworks.
    * [Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/dowhy/).
* [Expan](https://github.com/zalando/expan). From Zalando. A/B tests (a.k.a. Randomized Controlled Trials or Experiments) have been widely applied in different industries to optimize business processes and user experience. ExpAn (Experiment Analysis) is a Python library developed for the statistical analysis of such experiments and to standardise the data structures used.
* [CausalML](https://github.com/uber/causalml). From UBER AI team. Causal ML is a Python package that provides a suite of uplift modeling and causal inference methods using machine learning algorithms based on recent research. It provides a standard interface that allows user to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) or Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) from experimental or observational data. Essentially, it estimates the causal impact of intervention T on outcome Y for users with observed features X, without strong assumptions on the model form.
    * [docs](https://causalml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html).
    * [whitepaper/PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11631.pdf).
* [Causal Discovery Toolbox](https://github.com/FenTechSolutions/CausalDiscoveryToolbox). Package for causal inference in graphs and in the pairwise settings. Tools for graph structure recovery and dependencies are included.
* [CausalNex](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/causalnex). A Python library that helps data scientists to infer causation rather than observing correlation.

## Social Media APIs, scrappers, etc.
* [twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter). The Minimalist Twitter API for Python is a Python API for Twitter, everyone's favorite Web 2.0 Facebook-style status updater for people on the go. Also included is a Twitter command-line tool for getting your friends' tweets and setting your own tweet from the safety and security of your favorite shell and an IRC bot that can announce Twitter updates to an IRC channel.
* [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy). Classic twitter api adapter.
* [twfollowbot](https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot). A Python bot that automates several actions on Twitter, such as following users and favoriting tweets.


## Topic Extraction and Knowledge Mining
* [PYthon Automated Term Extraction](https://github.com/kevinlu1248/pyate). Python implementation of term extraction algorithms such as C-Value, Basic, Combo Basic, Weirdness and Term Extractor using spaCy POS tagging.
* [Graphbrain](https://github.com/graphbrain/graphbrain). Graphbrain is an Artificial Intelligence open-source software library and scientific research tool. Its aim is to facilitate automated meaning extraction and text understanding, as well as the exploration and inference of knowledge. [Docs here](https://graphbrain.net/overview/hypergraph.html).

## Scalability and Parallelization
* [Pandarallel](https://github.com/nalepae/pandarallel). A simple and efficient tool to parallelize Pandas operations on all available CPUs.
* [swifter](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter). A package which efficiently applies any function to a pandas dataframe or series in the fastest available manner.
